Connecting to Host

To connect to the host. First the client should send the connection request. 
The host program will then Store the relevant IP and then will find the lowest available number (looking through what PlayerId's are already taken)
the Host will send this data back to the client, having their local playerID set to this number
Then, a player will be added to the current list with a placeholdername, the players IP, ID, etc
Additionally a boolean "isLoaded" should be set to false to ensure this blank data does not get sent to players in the game
The player will then enter their Username of choice

Packets will have designations as the first two numbers to check what the packets "job" is
>//< refers to the data the packet is carrying
